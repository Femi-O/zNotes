# zNotes
The notes I take on anything coding. I update it as I learn more. The goal is to have everything I've ever learnt on coding in one place for easy reference to refresh my memory quickly, even if I stop coding for years.
I have noticed as I learn more that some of the things in this note are not accurate so I keep updating the note. I also keep adding new features as I skill up.
